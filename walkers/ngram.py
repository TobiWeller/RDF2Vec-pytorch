class NGramWalker(RandomWalker):
    """N-Gram walking strategy which relabels the n-grams in random walks to
    define a mapping from one-to-many. The intuition behind this is that the
    predecessors of a node that two different walks have in common can be
    different.

    Attributes:
        _is_support_remote: True if the walking strategy can be used with a
            remote Knowledge Graph, False Otherwise
            Defaults to True.
        _n_gram_map: Stores the mapping of N-gram.
            Defaults to {}.
        grams: The N-gram to relabel.
            Defaults to 3.
        kg: The global KG used later on for the worker process.
            Defaults to None.
        max_depth: The maximum depth of one walk.
        max_walks: The maximum number of walks per entity.
            Defaults to None.
        random_state: The random state to use to keep random determinism with
            the walking strategy.
            Defaults to None.
        sampler: The sampling strategy.
            Defaults to UniformSampler.
        wildcards: The wildcards to be used to match sub-sequences with small
            differences to be mapped onto the same label.
            Defaults to None.
