    Attributes:
        _inv_label_map: Stores the mapping of the inverse labels.
            Defaults to defaultdict.
        _is_support_remote: True if the walking strategy can be used with a
            remote Knowledge Graph, False Otherwise.
            Defaults to False.
        _label_map: Stores the mapping of the inverse labels.
            Defaults to defaultdict.
        kg: The global KG used later on for the worker process.
            Defaults to None.
        max_depth: The maximum depth of one walk.
        max_walks: The maximum number of walks per entity.
            Defaults to None.
        md5_bytes: The number of bytes to keep after hashing objects in
            MD5. Hasher allows to reduce the memory occupied by a long text. If
            md5_bytes is None, no hash is applied.
            Defaults to 8.
        random_state: The random state to use to keep random determinism with
            the walking strategy.
            Defaults to None.
        sampler: The sampling strategy.
            Defaults to UniformSampler.
