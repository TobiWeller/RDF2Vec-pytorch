    """Anonymous walking strategy which transforms each vertex name other than
    the root node, into positional information, in order to anonymize the
    randomly extracted walks.

    Attributes:
        _is_support_remote: True if the walking strategy can be used with a
            remote Knowledge Graph, False Otherwise
            Defaults to True.
        kg: The global KG used later on for the worker process.
            Defaults to None.
        max_depth: The maximum depth of one walk.
        max_walks: The maximum number of walks per entity.
            Defaults to None.
        random_state: The random state to use to keep random determinism with
            the walking strategy.
            Defaults to None.
        sampler: The sampling strategy.
            Defaults to UniformSampler.
        with_reverse: True to extracts parents and children hops from an
            entity, creating (max_walks * max_walks) more walks of 2 * depth,
            allowing also to centralize this entity in the walks. False
            otherwise.
