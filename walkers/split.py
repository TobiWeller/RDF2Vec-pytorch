class SplitWalker(RandomWalker):
    """Splitting walking strategy which splits each vertex (except the root
    node) present in the randomly extracted walks.

    Attributes:
        _is_support_remote: True if the walking strategy can be used with a
            remote Knowledge Graph, False Otherwise
            Defaults to True.
        kg: The global KG used later on for the worker process.
            Defaults to None.
        max_depth: The maximum depth of one walk.
        max_walks: The maximum number of walks per entity.
            Defaults to None.
        md5_bytes: The number of bytes to keep after hashing objects in
            MD5. Hasher allows to reduce the memory occupied by a long
            text. If md5_bytes is None, no hash is applied.
            Defaults to 8.
        random_state: The random state to use to keep random determinism with
            the walking strategy.
            Defaults to None.
        sampler: The sampling strategy.
            Defaults to UniformSampler.
        with_reverse: True to extracts parents and children hops from an
            entity, creating (max_walks * max_walks) walks of 2 * depth,
            allowing also to centralize this entity in the walks. False
            otherwise.
            Defaults to False.
        func_split: The function to call for the splitting of vertices. In case
            of reimplementation, it is important to respect the signature
            imposed by `basic_split` function.
            Defaults to func_split.
