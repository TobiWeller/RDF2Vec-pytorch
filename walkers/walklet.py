class WalkletWalker(RandomWalker):
    """Walklets walking strategy which transforms randomly extracted walks into
    walklets which are walks of size one or two including the root node and
    potentially another vertex that can be a predicate or an object.

    Attributes:
        _is_support_remote: True if the walking strategy can be used with a
            remote Knowledge Graph, False Otherwise
            Defaults to True.
        kg: The global KG used later on for the worker process.
            Defaults to None.
        max_depth: The maximum depth of one walk.
        max_walks: The maximum number of walks per entity.
            Defaults to None.
        random_state: The random state to use to keep random determinism with
            the walking strategy.
            Defaults to None.
        sampler: The sampling strategy.
            Defaults to UniformSampler.
        with_reverse: True to extracts parents and children hops from an
            entity, creating (max_walks * max_walks) walks of 2 * depth,
            allowing also to centralize this entity in the walks. False
            otherwise.
            Defaults to False.
